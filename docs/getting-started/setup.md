# Setting Up LowCodeUnit

Fathym LowCodeUnit enables developers to rapidly build, host, and manage applications.

In this getting started guide, in only a few clicks you'll be able to work with custom and emulated device data.  We'll walk through connecting application code for hosting, and once setup, show how to secure applications, manage version and how to get things running on a custom domain.  Finally, we'll walk through how to deliver applications leveraging the underlying micro-frontend engine.  

To kick things off, visit the [LowCodeUnit](https://www.lowcodeunit.com/dashboard) sign up page (no credit card required) and access the dashboard.

## LowCodeUnit Dashboard
